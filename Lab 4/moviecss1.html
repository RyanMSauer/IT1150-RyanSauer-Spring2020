            <h2>Why They Are So Great</h2>
            <p>The Lord of the Rings is an amazing trilogy. It not only provides an entertaining experience, but also gives the audience something to take away. The themes of friendship, perseverance, and the pursuit of good will be something I carry with me all my life. I think that the subject matter of the movie Is something that scares people away. While a fantasy setting can make you feel a little silly while watching it, there is a lot more to offer. The cinematography of the movie is amazing, and they were still using practical effects while filming. The combination of those two things really captivate you and let you get lost in the story that they are telling.</p>
