            <h2>Seeking Something Greater</h2>
            <p>There is something unobtainable inherent in the act of cooking. It is a constant struggle for perfection in a pursuit that is ultimately subjective. The dichotomy of those two ideas is what makes it so alluring to so many people. It teaches you values that are essential to be successful. It makes you understand that if you ever reach a level of perfection, that you are ultimately satisfied with, you ought to redefine you standards and try to achieve something greater.</p>
            <h2>Feeding Your Soul</h2>
            <p>The act of cooking for someone else is an intimate experience. Caring for a person in that way forms a connection between you and them. It is unbelievably fulfilling to have a connection like that, and to be the person initiating it.</p>
